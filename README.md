# Super-Store-Dashboard
This project is a Power BI dashboard built using the Superstore dataset. It provides a clear, visual analysis of sales, profit, product performance, and customer behavior. The goal is to help viewers understand key business insights in a simple and interactive way.

Key Features
1. KPI Summary

The dashboard starts with four main performance indicators:

Total Sales: $1.92M

Total Profit: $224K

Total Quantity Sold: 25K

Total Orders: 1952

These KPIs give a quick snapshot of overall business performance.

2. Monthly Sales & Profit Trend

A combined line and clustered column chart shows monthly sales and profit values. This helps identify seasonal trends, peak months, and periods of low profitability.

3. Customer Segment Performance

A bar chart compares sales across four segments: Corporate, Home Office, Consumer, and Small Business. This highlights which segment contributes the most revenue.

4. Sales by Product Category

Sales are broken down into major product categories and sub-categories. This allows detailed analysis of which product groups generate the highest revenue.

5. Product Category Contribution

A donut chart shows the percentage share of Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies in total sales, making it easy to understand category distribution.

6. Top 6 Products (Sales & Profit)

Two separate bar charts highlight the top-performing products—one based on sales and one based on profit. This reveals high-demand and high-margin items.

7. Top 6 Cities by Profit

A bar chart shows which cities generate the most profit, enabling a quick view of geographic performance.
